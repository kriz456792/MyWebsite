                <span class="square"></span>
                <p>
                    When I was a child, my dream was to become an inventor. One time I
                    decided to cut an electric cord, get a light bulb socket, a plug, and
                    wired everything up. Fearfully I slowly plugged in my made-up lamp and
                    to my surprise it worked, but when I tried unplugging it, I got
                    shocked but that did not stop me. The very next week, I had a school
                    project where I had to create a made-up cardboard electric device. I
                    ended up making a small hole in the front of the made-up cardboard
                    radio and tapping up my lamp through the hole, and I also didn't forget
                    to rewire the made-up lamp so that it wouldn't shock me again. The day
                    I presented my made-up cardboard radio I felt proud.
                    <br /><br />
                    It would be a long time before I would try to pursue technology. First,
                    at the age of 18(close to 19), I decided to pursue entrepreneurship. I
                    started a small business selling "As seen on TV" products all over 
                    California, in some parts of Arizona and in Nevada. My business 
                    generated between 250,000 and 500,000 yearly with a few employees and 
                    myself. In this chapter of my life, I learned a lot about running a 
                    business, managing people, and most importantly I learned about failure.
                    <br /><br />
                    Fast Forward a couple of years, and I decided to pursue a college 
                    education. I didn't know what field of study I'd pursue, but I knew I'd 
                    never give up. Eventually I would gain interest in Software Development, 
                    and I would make the decision to pursue a career in technology. Today 
                    is very clear that the child in me who dreamed about becoming an 
                    inventor now can make an impact, to be part of something great, to 
                    develop software, systems, applications. All things that other people 
                    and businesses could use.

                    This project was made using the Qt Framework writen in the

                        Currently my interest in technology are Machine Learning, Desktop Applications,
                        Mobile Applications, and Robotics. On a daily basis I spend time working on my
                        personal projects: this website, applications, studying Machine Learning, etc.
                        <br /><br />
                        On a weekly basis I spend a large chunk of my time programming, working out, reading, and
                        listening to podcast. Some of my inspiration comes from
                        the work of others like George Hotz(Comma.ai & george hotz archives YT), Andrew Ng,
                        Loi Liang Yang and YouTube channels like The Chreno, javidx9, and many more.
                        <br /><br />
                        My favorite programming language is C++, which I describe as elegant and powerful. Although
                        C++ is my first and favorite langue, I do not limit myself to it. I've also writen code in 
                        Python, Java, JavaScript, QML, HTML, and CSS. Learning is a life long journey, and I enjoy
                        getting out of my comfort zone to learn new technologies.
